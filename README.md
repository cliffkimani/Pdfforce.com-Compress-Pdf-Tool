### Compress PDF – Reduce File Size Without Losing Quality

The Compress PDF tool on PDFForce is designed to solve one of the most common document challenges: PDFs that are too large to upload, email, or store efficiently. High-resolution images, scanned pages, and embedded content often cause PDFs to grow unnecessarily large, creating friction in otherwise simple workflows.

PDFForce’s Compress PDF tool intelligently reduces file size while preserving the original layout, text clarity, and image quality. This allows you to share and store documents more easily without sacrificing readability or professionalism. The entire process runs directly in your browser, with no software installation required.

Compressing PDFs is especially useful when submitting documents to platforms with strict file size limits, sending attachments via email, or managing cloud storage efficiently. Instead of recreating documents or lowering quality manually, compression provides a fast and reliable solution.

Compress PDF is commonly used together with 
[Merge PDF](https://pdfforce.com/tools/merge) after combining multiple files, 
[Split PDF](https://pdfforce.com/tools/split) when working with large documents, and 
[Protect PDF](https://pdfforce.com/tools/protect) to secure compressed files before sharing.

For scanned documents, users often apply 
[OCR PDF](https://pdfforce.com/tools/ocr) to make files searchable and then compress them for easier distribution. When reusing content, 
[Extract Images](https://pdfforce.com/tools/extract_images) and 
[Extract Text](https://pdfforce.com/tools/extract_text) can be combined with compression to optimize both file size and usability.

Compress PDF on PDFForce is built for students, professionals, and teams who need predictable results without complicated settings. Whether you’re preparing reports, archiving records, or sharing documents online, the tool helps reduce friction and keep your PDF workflow efficient.
